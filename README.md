# Machine-Learning-Supervised-Classification

Using the "simu.txt" data, the objective is to find the best possible model to model the binary variable Y from two other variables.
I found that the most appropriate model was a KNN with 27 neighbours, it has an average accuracy of 81%. 
I then used the "xsimutest" file to predict 1000 observations of variable Y.
